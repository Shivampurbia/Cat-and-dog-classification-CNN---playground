# Cat-and-dog-classification-CNN---playground
The most famous practical example of learning the very basics of CNN and Deep learning.

This Python program is divided into 3 parts as follows,

1. learning how to preprocess the image data and converting them to feature vectors.                                                      
   1.a. saving the preprocesseed data using pickel.
	
2. training the neural network(CNN) with those Features.
  
3. preprocessing the testing dataset and predicting with the trained network.                                                            
   3.a. exporting a .csv file of predictions
